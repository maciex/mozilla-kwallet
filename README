 Warning

 This code/repository is of an old version of the KWallet Add-On, not supporting KDE 5 and Firefox >= 57.
 I won't be fixing this to work with latest Firefox.
 I'm not the main developer of this Add on.
 
 There's also a newer add-on for KDE5, but it also won't work on Firefox 57 without fixing (I'm not even sure if it's possible).  Web site of Add-on can be found here: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/kde5-wallet-password-integrati/  And the home page of the developer: http://www.guillermomolina.com/en/
 
 
 KDE Wallet password integration

Firefox stores its passwords internaly, optionally protected by a master password. KDE has its own password manager called KWallet.
KWallet stores every password in the KDE system, and protects access by a master password. With this extension you are able to use KWallet instead of the default Firefox password manager. It allows tighter integration of Firefox inside KDE.
This extension is compatible with KDE4.X and Firefox 3.5.
